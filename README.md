Diabetes is a chronic disease which occurs either when the pancreas does not produce eniugh insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.
The aim of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Modelling of  Diabetes Dataset to better understand features contributing to diabetes and help health institutes predict diabetes in patients using thier records in order to better prioritize attending to patients more likely to be diabetic.
